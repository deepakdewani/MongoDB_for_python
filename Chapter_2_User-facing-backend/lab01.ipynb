    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the method get_movies in db.py to allow for paging. You can see how the page is parsed and sent in the api_search_movies method from movies.py.\n",

    "You can find examples of using cursor methods in notebooks/cursor_methods_agg_equivalents.ipynb.\n",
